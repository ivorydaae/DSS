## Introduction

During this course, students will learn how to build a predictive model using Dataiku DSS, a collaborative Data Science platform.  

While learning how to use the platform, students will be exposed to typical company use cases, falling into the Enterprise AI field.  

They will learn and re-learn Data Science core concepts, from the identification of a need up to the interpretation of Machine Learning model.  

They will also work with various Data Science technologies (including Python & SQL) to better analyse their data, and interact with the platform in a different way.  

Students will also go through every steps of a Data Science workflow (import, cleaning, analysing, visualising, feature engineering & predicting)

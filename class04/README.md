The last class will be a project you will have to work on on your own with some guidance during the class.
## Final Project  

For the final class, students will work **on their own** on a specific use case called `House Pricing`. This use case has been created based on [Aurélien Géron's Book: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml). Our goal will be to predict the price of a house in San Francisco... with Dataiku. We will start building our workflow together and you will be guided through a various set of steps and tasks to finish the project.  

## Content 

You will carefully follow the different steps from importing your data to scoring your `test` dataset while building a dashboard in DSS with your analysis, including coding and visual recipes and more.  

All tasks and steps will be detailled in the slides, with a correction updated at the end of the class.  

Slides will be available on Thursday, April 16th with all the instructions. You will be evaluated on your project but we will work together on some new features.  

Correction will be accessible after the class.
